Name: NAPTHA

An OoldSkool demo inspired by a live performance I attended and captured of "NAFT", a Belgian Live Analog Techno band.

The main song is based on "Paroxysm" by Naft.

Creator: Steffest
System: Amiga OCS
Runs on Amiga 500 with a 512kb memory expansion and beyond.
Amiga's with a harddisk can use the exe in the "harddisk" folder directly.

Released at RSYNC Demoparty 2025

Tools Used:

Graphics: 
Based on live footage from the band "NAFT"
Images where first sketched on paper and then produced in PhotoShop, including the Generative Fill tool, so I guess they are not AI free.
Images were finalized and pixel optimised in Dpaint.js: https://www.stef.be/dpaint/
Some chunky-pixel animations were taken from Giphy.

Music:
The main theme and some samples where lifted from the song "Paroxysm" by Naft using various stem-splitting tools.
The mod file was composed by hand using BassoonTracker: https://www.stef.be/bassoontracker/
The disk version of naphta uses a lower-quality compressed mod file to make it fit on a single disk and in 512k chip ram.

Code:
Home-cooked hardware banging C.
Compiled with SAS-C on the Amiga (but written in modern editors)
A big thanks to Wei-ju Wu for his YouTube series "Amiga Hardware Programming in C" which pointed me in a direction i could wrap my head around.
The blitter routines are heavily based on his examples.
Still bloody slow though... but boy, did I have fun.
Now I understand why everybody loves the Amiga Custom chips so much.
